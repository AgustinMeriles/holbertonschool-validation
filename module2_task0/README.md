The `build` target compiles the Go source code into an executable named awesome-api.

The `run` target runs the executable in the background, captures its process ID (PID) in a file named awesome-api.pid, and waits for a second to give the server time to start up.

The `stop` target stops the running application by killing its PID (if it exists) and removing the PID file.

The `test` target runs a couple of tests against the running server using curl.

The `clean` target removes the binary and log files, and stops the running application if it is still running.

Finally, the `help` target prints a help message with descriptions of each target.
